# License-Plate-Recognition

The aim of this project is to allow user to utilise the conveience of entering and exiting the parking in a building. Computer Vision with YOLOv5 algorithm is implemented to recognise the registered plate number and auto deduct the parking fee during exit. 

A web-based application is also implemented for user to control and manage the vehicle entering and leaving the building. Users can view the record of the vehicle and check the amount of reduced parking fee.
